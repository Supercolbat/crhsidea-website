# CS/IDEA

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` or `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open

# expose to local network
pnpm dev --host
```

## Building

To create a production version of the website:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
